Welcome to my digital notebook.

This site is where I document my work, ideas, and occasionally, half-baked thoughts about the wonderful (and sometimes chaotic) world of multiphase flows and simulation. I created this space to:

- Showcase the projects I’ve worked on in CFD and HPC
- Write about combining machine learning with fluid mechanics
- Share code, insights, and tools I’ve developed along the way
- Reflect on the research process — from debugging particle collisions to conference talks

If you’re curious about anything here — or want to collaborate — feel free to reach out!

Thanks for stopping by.
