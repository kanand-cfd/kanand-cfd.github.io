I'm **Karan Anand**, a CFD engineer and researcher with a PhD in Fluid Mechanics.
I specialize in **multiphase flow simulations**, **high-performance computing**, and more recently, **machine learning for fluid dynamics**.

On this site, you’ll find:
- My latest **[projects](/projects)** in CFD and simulation
- A bit **[about me](/about)**
- My full **[CV](/cv)** and publications
- A growing **[blog](/posts)** where I’ll share updates, technical insights, and the occasional rabbit hole

I'm currently exploring opportunities and collaborations at the intersection of **CFD, multiphase flows, and ML** — so if you have something interesting in mind, [reach out](/contact).

Enjoy your stay!
