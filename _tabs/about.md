I'm Karan Anand, PhD — a CFD engineer who spends most of his time simulating particles that are much too small to care, but crucial enough to power the next generation of clean energy. My background spans gas-solid multiphase flow simulations, high-performance computing, and the delightful intersection of fluid dynamics and machine learning.

Currently, I’m a postdoc at the Laboratoire de Génie Chimique in Toulouse, where I work on Euler-Euler and CFD-DEM modeling of fluidized beds (think: particle mosh pits with real-world consequences). I’ve coded contact detection for ellipsoids, simulated chemical looping combustion, wrangled petabytes on French supercomputers, and even collaborated with PEPT experimentalists from the University of Birmingham. Before this, I earned a double Master's in Fluids Engineering (INSA Toulouse) and CFD (India), and spent a year and a half studying hydrophobic hydrofoils at IMFT.

Now, I’m looking for exciting R&D projects at the intersection of CFD, multiphase flows, and machine learning — especially those that let me push the boundaries of simulation and data-driven modeling. If that’s your thing too, let’s talk.
